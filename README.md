# Motor-Vehicle-Theft-in-New-Zealand
## Project Overview

In this project, I conducted an in-depth analysis of motor vehicle theft incidents in New Zealand between October 2021 and April 2022. The goal was to identify key trends and risk factors based on vehicle characteristics, location, and time. 
## Insights derived from the dataset
<p> •	Total Thefts: A total of 4,509 vehicles were reported stolen during the 7-month period. </p>
<p> •	Region Most Affected: Auckland emerged as the most vulnerable region, accounting for 34% of all reported thefts. </p>
<p> •	Most Stolen Brand: Toyota was the most frequently stolen brand, making up 16% of the total stolen vehicles. </p>
<p> •	Peak Month: The highest number of thefts occurred in March 2022, with 23.2% of the total cases reported in that month alone. </p>
<p> •	Most Vulnerable Model Year: Vehicles manufactured in 2005 were most targeted, with 346 theft cases. </p>
<p> •	Most Targeted Car Color: Silver cars were most at risk, involved in 28.1% of the reported thefts. </p>

This analysis provides valuable insights for law enforcement agencies, insurance companies, and car owners, highlighting theft-prone regions, timeframes, and vehicle characteristics. The full analysis includes data cleaning, visualization, and exploration steps using Microsoft Excel.
